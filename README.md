# simulator-proxy
Put dropbox uploading script from https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader in ~

Current plan:
- try to push broadcast to the limit by increasing the number of drones
- automate data collection and plotting process
- randomize/offset traces so that all links aren't bad at the same time
- implement some routing-based optimization to compare with broadcast
