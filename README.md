# simulator-proxy
Here live some tools I built out for my MEng project to work with packet traces I collected while flying a drone. The library used to simulate a fleet of drones is in ```simulation``` and the executable tool itself is in ```tools/simulator```. The library built to query trace data is in ```querying```. Other tools I used to test and run experiments are in ```tools```. 

Some parts of this tooling are quite specific to my setup. Other parts of it are more widely usable. Please reach out to me at aditisri@mit.edu with any questions.
